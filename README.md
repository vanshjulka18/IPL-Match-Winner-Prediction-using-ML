# IPL Match Winner Prediction using Machine Learning

## üèÜ Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the winner of an IPL match. By analyzing historical data such as match statistics, player performance, weather conditions, and team statistics, we aim to create a reliable model to assist in match outcome predictions.

Key Features:
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess raw IPL data for efficient model training.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from raw data, such as player stats, team performance, and match conditions.
- Model Training: Train multiple machine learning algorithms to determine the best prediction model.
- Performance Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Data

The data used in this project includes historical IPL match data. The dataset contains information on teams, player performance, toss results, match results, and more.

### Running the Project

1. **Preprocessing Data**: The first step is cleaning and preprocessing the raw data to make it usable for training. 

2. **Training the Model**: After preprocessing, we use various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to train the model. 

3. **Predicting Results**: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict the winner of future IPL matches by providing necessary input features.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, the model is evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to measure its performance.


### Metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct predictions.
- **Precision**: Proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
- **Recall**: Proportion of actual positives that were correctly identified.
- **F1-Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
